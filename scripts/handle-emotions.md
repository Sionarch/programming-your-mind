# Distancing yourself from emotions

When you become aware that you are emotional, you can use this script to distance yourself from the emotion (decentering). Try this when you are feeling stressed, worried, critical and so on.

- I am conscious
- I am aware
- I am thinking that I am stressed (replace "stressed" with the negative feeling you want to let go of)
- It is just a thought, it is just an emotion
- I don't have to do anything about it
- I am not my thoughts
- I am not my emotions
- I am the existence that is here and now
- I exist in this body, in this place, in this moment
- I am conscious
- I am aware of teh time of the day
- I am aware of where I am
- I am doing a mindfulness practice
