# Mindfulness script for awareness of the physical present

The purpose of this script is to increase awarness of your physical existence. Focusing on the physical present is a way to exit the thought loop of negative emotions, such as worry, doubt, fear, anxiety. To exist in the present can result in feelings of calm and peace, and also happiness. To enjoy your existence without doing anything. To experience what is here and now without juding it. Without projecting any likes and dislikes into what you observe. To simply exist.

Say to yourself:

- I am conscious
- I am aware of the time of the day
- I am aware of where I am
- I exist here and now
- I am aware of my body
- I am aware of my feet
- I am aware of the ground
- I feel the contact between my feet and the ground
- I am aware of the stability of the ground
- I am aware of the air that surrounds me
- Air is flowing in and out of my body
- I am aware of my breath
- My breath is real
- The air is real
- The ground is real
- My body is real
- I exist in this place, in this moment
- My existence is real
- I am doing a mindfulness practice
